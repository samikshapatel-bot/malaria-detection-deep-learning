🦠 Malaria Detection Using Deep Learning
Project Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. Early detection is important for proper treatment.

This project uses **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** to automatically detect **malaria-infected cells from microscopic blood smear images**.

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is trained to classify images into:

* Parasitized (infected)
* Uninfected (healthy)

The trained model is integrated into a **Flask web application**, allowing users to upload a blood cell image and receive an instant prediction.

🎯 Objectives
* Detect malaria infection using microscopic images
* Use Deep Learning for medical image classification
* Build an automated diagnostic system
* Create a web application for easy prediction

🧠 Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Flask
* HTML / CSS

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains **microscopic blood smear images** divided into two categories:

* **Parasitized** → infected red blood cells
* **Uninfected** → healthy red blood cells

Images are used for training and validation of the model.
